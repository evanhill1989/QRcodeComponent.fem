## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

Somewhat familiar with what flex display does and guessed that's what I needed to understand. So i just reviewed some basics from w3schools. I did design with the idea that my code should be amenable to building more page elements on top of this, so that's why I didn't take some of the cleaner shortcuts that maybe I could/should have.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Just starting to learn CSS really. I've been designing in WordPress and use CSS snippets sometimes, but haven't built any complete modern pages with just HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

Get more comfortable with Flexbox. My goal is to continue to develop with WordPress builder, but feel like workflow will be even faster if I have a more holistic understanding of CSS as opposed to looking up fragments as I hit a problem there's no other way around.
